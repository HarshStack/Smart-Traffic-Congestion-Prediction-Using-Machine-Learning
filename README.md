# 🚦 Smart Traffic Congestion Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting traffic congestion levels using machine learning models trained on real-world traffic datasets. By analyzing key features such as time, location, and road conditions, the system can forecast traffic patterns and help improve city mobility, route planning, and smart traffic management systems.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a machine learning-based solution that:

* Predicts the level of traffic congestion at a given time and location
* Helps urban planners and citizens make informed decisions
* Can be extended to real-time applications in smart city infrastructure

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traffic congestion is a growing issue in urban areas, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. Predictive analytics can provide valuable insights to anticipate congestion and take proactive steps to mitigate it.
